Exam for the course DAT171 Object oriented programming in Python
===========

**Date:** 14th March 2017 8:30-12:30

**Teachers:** Thomas Svedberg (031 772 1522), Mikael Öhman (mobile: 0736 837 674)

**Permitted aids:** Cay Horstmann: Python for everyone. Manuals and lecture notes are available on the computers.

**Teacher will visit the rooms:** Around 9:30 and 11:00-11:30


**Formalities**: You must write the examination code and the computer number on the exam cover and in each file you hand in.

The documentation and lectures notes are available in `C:\__EXAM__`. Immediately verify that these files are there.
Handing in the code should be done under the same folder: `C:\__EXAM__\Assignments\`, when you are finished. If you do not store the files here, they are not included in the exam. Save the files for each question in the appropriate folder, e.g. `C:\__EXAM__\Assignments\Question1\`.
*Make sure you only hand in one solution for each question, otherwise you will receive **zero** points.*
Complex sections of your code should have a descriptive comment of what is achieved.

When you finish the exam you should log out and fill in the (empty) exam cover page like normal and hand this in at the end of the exam.

**Corrections:** The results will be announced at the latest on 28th of March on the course homepage.
The review will be the same day 12:20-13:00 and on the 29th of March 12:20-13:00.

**Grading:** 
There is a total of 25 points which yields grades at the standard 40%, 60%, and 80% limits:
```python
def grade(points):
    if points >= 20:
        return 'Grade 5'
    elif points >= 15:
        return 'Grade 4'
    elif points >= 10:
        return 'Grade 3'
    else:
        return 'Fail'
```

Question 1 (6p total)
==========

Spell-correction is a convenient tool when editing text.
A simple form of spell-correction is to look up all words to see if there are any replacements.

In the following assignments, you are given a set of example files to work with.
Try your code on ```spelling_corrections.txt``` and ```text_with_typos.txt``` but remember that your code should be general enough to handle other similar files.

Part A (2p)
-----------

You have a file ```spelling_correct.txt``` that contains many entries like:
```
you : {yuo}
you're : {youre, yuore}
neighbour : { nieghbour, neigbour, neigbourh}
...
```

Write a function ```read_spellcorrections(filename)``` that reads and parses this file, and store the spell correction information in a dictionary, so that we can look up each word and correct it.

Example:
```python
>>> speller = read_spellcorrections('spell_corrections.txt')
>>> print(speller['nieghbour'])
neighbour
```

Part B (1p)
----------

Write a small helper function ```split_punctuation(text)``` that takes a string consisting of a single word and splits it into 2 parts, the word and the punctuation.
The second part should be an empty string if there is no punctuation.

Example:
```python
>>> split_punctuation('Tiger!')
('Tiger', '!')
>>> split_punctuation('cat')
('cat', '')
>>> split_punctuation('sigh...')
('sigh', '...')
```

The code must handle dots, commas, colons, semicolons, question- and exclamation-marks  ```.,:;?!```

Part B (3p)
-----------
Write a function ```correct_file(input_filename, output_filename, speller)``` which reads the input file and applies the spelling corrections to each word, and storecorrected text to a the output file.

Your code needs to account for:

 * Punctuation (.,:;?!). "Have yuo seen my neighbourh?" should become "Have you seen my neighbour?"
 * Capitalization of words. "Wantid, daed or alive." should become "Wanted, dead or alive."

**Optional**: You may write a code that handles more special cases (not required):

 * "ALL CAPS" words
 * Other special characters like parenthesis.
 * Hyphenation (the - at line breaks).

*Hint: `str.isupper`, `str.lower`, `str.split`, `str.strip`, `str.capitalize` are all useful methods for this assignment.*

Question 2 (5p total)
=====================

As a result of an evaluation we have found that the process we are studying can be described by the function
$y = f(x) = (x - a)^2 + b \, \sin(x)$ with $a=1$ and $b=10$.

To continue our study we need to find the minima and root(s) of this function.

Start by plotting the function in the intervall $-10 \leq x \leq 10$ to get a feel for how it looks.

Part A (2p)
-----------
Using the function *minimize* from the SciPy library ```optimize```, find the _local_ minima of the function using the methods:

* Conjugate Gradient (CG)
* Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS)
* Powell (Powell)

and the starting guesses for $x$: $1, 5, 7, 10$.

Print the resulting $x, y$ values for each combination of method and start guess.

Part B (1p)
-----------
Find the _global_ minima of the function using a _global_ optimization method from the ```optimize``` library.

Print the resulting $x, y$ values.

Part C (1p)
-----------
Find the _roots_ ($f(x)=0$) of the function using a suitable method from the ```optimize``` library.

*Hint: You probably need to give different start guesses to find the different roots!*

Part D (1p)
-----------
Using a 2x2 subplot grid, plot the function for $-10 \leq x \leq 10$ in each subplot.

For each of the local methods in Part A, mark the minima found with a suitable marker in subplots 1-3.

In the fourth subplot, mark the global minima and roots with suitable markers. Make sure to use different markers for minima and roots.

In all subplots add a title, axis labels etc.

*Hint: Matplotlib manual is extensive. You will likely find what you need in part I.*

\newpage

Question 3 (6p total)
=====================

In this assignment you will create a class `StopWatch` that models a simple stopwatch with "start", "stop" and "reset" functionality.

Part A (4p)
-----------
Implement the following:

* A constructor that can accept an arbitrary starting time (in seconds), e.g. `StopWatch(5)` must create a stopwatch
  that is initially set to 5 second.
* `start()` - Starts the watch. If the watch is already started, must raise a `StopWatchException` (create it yourself) with an
              informative error message.
* `stop()` - Stops the watch. If the watch is already stopped, must raise a `StopWatchException` with an informative error message.
* `reset()` - Resets the watch, i.e. sets the current elapsed time to 0 seconds and stops it.
* `get_time()` - Returns the current elapsed time, i.e. what is currently on the display of the stopwatch (in seconds).

You must not use any other functions found in the `time`, `datetime` or `calendar` modules other than the ones listed in the hints below.

*Hint: Use `time.time()` to get the number of seconds elapsed since the epoch (1 January 1970).*

*Hint: Use `time.sleep(t)`, to sleep (do nothing) for `t` seconds when testing your code.*

Part B (2p)
-----------
Methods must be implemented for the following operations:

* The ```StopWatch``` objects should support the `<` and `==` operators based on the elapsed time.
* Printing a ```StopWatch``` object should yield output in the format `{a}H:{b}m:{c}s:{d}` where `{a}` is the number of hours, `{b}` is
the number of minutes, `{c}` is the number of seconds and `{d}` is the number of hundreds of seconds. For example:
`print(StopWatch(12313.327)` should print `3H:25m:13s:33` (note that `a, b, c, d` are all integers).

\newpage
Examples
--------
Below is some code you can use to test your code. The expected result from running this code is shown after the test code block.

```python
print("Creating watch at 5.22 seconds")
watch = StopWatch(5.22)
print(watch)
print("Starting watch and waiting 1 second")
watch.start(); sleep(1); print(watch)
print("Waiting one more second")
sleep(1); print(watch)
print("Stopping and waiting 1 second, watch is the same")
watch.stop(); sleep(1); print(watch)
print("Starting watch again and waiting 1 second")
watch.start(); sleep(1); print(watch)
print("Resetting watch")
watch.reset(); print(watch)
print("Starting and waiting 1 second")
watch.start(); sleep(1); print(watch)
print("Pretty print a watch:", StopWatch(12313.327))
print("equals and <:")
print(StopWatch(5.22) == StopWatch(5.22))
print(StopWatch() < StopWatch(2.0))
print("Stopping a stopped watch raises an exception:")
StopWatch().stop()
print("Starting a started watch raises an exception:")
watch = StopWatch()
watch.start(); watch.start()
```

Question 4 (8p total)
=====================

When developing a 2D-meshing tool, we need to mark a selection of geometries we are working with.
We wish to handle selections based on nodes (points), areas (triangles), or edges (made up of triangle edges).
The mesh is made up of a list of coordinates, and a list of triangles (each made up of 3 nodes).
A set of example files are given for a very small mesh that you can work with (you can look at the file contents in PyCharm):

```python
from numpy import loadtxt, int32
coords, triangles = loadtxt('coords.txt'), loadtxt('triangles.txt', dtype=int32)
```

![Mesh and edge numbering](mesh.png){ width=60% }  ![Bounding box](bbox.png){ width=35% }

Part A (2p)
-----------
Create a base class ```MeshSelection``` that stores the mesh and has the following methods:

* ```.area()``` (abstract) must return the area of the selection.
* ```.node_list()``` (abstract) must return a (unique) list of all nodes that are included in the selection.
* ```.bounding_box()``` must return a pair of coordinates which marks the lower left and upper right 
corners of the smallest enclosing box of the selection.

*Hint: Use ```node_list``` to implement ```bounding_box``` (```numpy.amin``` and ```numpy.amax``` are useful here)*

Part B (1p)
-----------
Make a subclass ```NodeSelection``` whose constructor takes a mesh (triangles and coordinates) as input.
Overload the abstract methods, and implement the method ```add_node(self, node_index)``` which adds another node to the initially empty selection.

Part C (2p)
-----------
Make a subclass ```AreaSelection``` whose constructor takes a mesh (triangles and coordinates) as input.
Overload the abstract methods, and implement the method ```add_triangle(self, triangle_index)``` which adds another triangle to the initially empty selection.

*Hint: The area of a single triangle is * $\frac12 | x_0 ( y_1 - y_2 ) + x_1 ( y_2 - y_0 ) + x_2 ( y_0 - y_1 ) |$

Part D (3p)
-----------
Make a subclass ```EdgeSelection``` whose constructor takes a mesh (coordinates and triangles) as input.
Overload the abstract methods, and implement the method ```add_edge(self, triangle_index, edge_index)``` which adds another edge to the initially empty selection.

The triangle has 3 edges, which are numbered as follows; 
edge `0` between nodes `[0,1]`, edge `1` between nodes `[1,2]`, edge `2` between nodes `[2,0]` (see image).

\newpage
Examples usage (based on given files ```triangles.txt``` and ```coords.txt```):

```python
from numpy import loaxtxt, int32, amin, amax
coords, triangles = loadtxt('coords.txt'), loadtxt('triangles.txt', dtype=int32)

nsel = NodeSelection(triangles, coords)
nsel.add_node(3)
nsel.add_node(4)
print('nsel:', nsel.node_list())
print('nsel:', nsel.bounding_box())
print('nsel:', nsel.area())

asel = AreaSelection(triangles, coords)
asel.add_triangle(3)
asel.add_triangle(4)
print('asel:', asel.node_list())
print('asel:', asel.bounding_box())
print('asel:', asel.area())

esel = EdgeSelection(triangles, coords)
esel.add_edge(3, 1)
esel.add_edge(4, 0)
print('esel:', esel.node_list())
print('esel:', esel.bounding_box())
print('esel:', esel.area())
```
output
```
nsel: [3, 4]
nsel: (array([ 0.17773562,  0.81735388]), array([ 0.477895  ,  0.92103199]))
nsel: 0
asel: [8, 9, 2, 3]
asel: (array([ 0.17773562,  0.29863832]), array([ 0.39742145,  0.92103199]))
asel: 0.0486705804532
esel: [8, 9, 3]
esel: (array([ 0.17773562,  0.29863832]), array([ 0.2531675 ,  0.92103199]))
esel: 0
```

If you want to test with random data:
```python
coords = numpy.rand(100, 2)
triangles = scipy.spatial.Delaunay(coords).simplices
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.triplot(coords[:,0], coords[:,1], triangles)
```
