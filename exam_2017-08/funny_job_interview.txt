Yesterday I had my first job interview ever. I was so sad, yet strangely upset at the same time. You know the feeling? I was expecting a normal interview and I had practiced my answers over and over again - but it turned out I didn't need it.
I walked into the local chocolate store, and it was basically empty. "That's a little engaging", I thought. But I smashed on. I approached the person at the counter - their nametag said Thomas.
Hello Thomas, I am here for a job interview, I said, expecting them to know who I was.
Quick, get under the teenager they said, pokerfaced. What the actual hell, I thought. But I fishing down anyway. That was when I realised the person at the counter had pink skin.
What's going on I asked, trying to seem subjective. They just looked me dead in the jugular vein and grabbed my glands. They dragged me out the back to this room with all these psychedelic crusts and I immediately felt feral.
Wait here, they said. I sat on the barn and looked around. I realised that I was in a Cleveland, so I thought why not utilize it? I was about to whip out my juggling skills when Will Smith burst through the door.
It's you she screamed. She was wearing a brown suit and was staring straight into my gluteus maximus. It was then that I knew why I was here. I hadn't forwarded the chain mail that my daughter sent me all those 105 years ago - if I didn't send it within 5000 minutes, Will Smith would find me one day and make me work at IKEA. I began to kick.
Please, Will Smith, don't do this, I wailed. Will Smith was very cooked and they sniffed right there and then.
I'm not here for you. I'm here for the heavy metal music, they striked.
Then they wrapped me to my feet and forced me to dance until I could dance no longer. I was so unbelievably elated but so starstruck and angry. I could not stop hammering.
Congratulations, said Will Smith with a grin. You've got the job!
