# Content
* Basic building blocks of a Python program (variables, conditional statements, loops, libraries, functions, errors)
* Data structures (lists, sets, dictionaries, tuples)
* Object Oriented programming (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes)
* PySide for creating graphical user interfaces (newer PyQt)
* NumPy (Matrices, vectors, linear algebra)
* SciPy (Package for numerical computations)
* Matplotlib (Plotting)
* Interactive Python (ipython)



# Learning outcome
After successfully passing the course, the student should be able to independently write object oriented software using Python.

Furthermore, the student should be able to read reference literature for the Python programming language as well as being able to use the SciPy/NumPy package for numerical computations and PySide (Qt) for writing graphical user interfaces.



# Examination
Will take place in computer rooms at 19th of March 2015 in the afternoon. The re-exam will be in august.

* Book is allowed...
* but there will also be reference materials available on the computers
* 4 hours examination
* 5 questions $\times$ 5 points per question
    * 10 points for passing grade
    * 15 points for grade 4
    * 20 points for grade 5

* Will get back to you later when rooms are booked and precisely what documents will be available.
* The exam will not contain anything on the GUI (4 hours would be insufficient)


# Assignments
3 compulsory assignments worth 1hp each which represents 26 hours of work per student.
Assignments may be done alone of in groups of 2.

Please do not cheat! Ask each other questions, but don't share sections of code directly.
_DETECTED CHEATING WILL BE REPORTED_



# Assignment 1: Creating a graph of adjacent points and finding the shortest route
From a file containing coordinates, the goal is to construct a adjacency graph of the coordinates
and find the shortest path between the given start and end point.

* Getting familiar with Python
* Reading files
* Using NumPy for numerics
* Using more advanced data structures (KDTree and sparse graph library from SciPy)
* Matplotlib



# Assignment 2: Playing card library + Game
The first part of the task is to create a library for making card games, then use it to create a simple card game.

* Creating a library
* Creating classes



# Assignment 3: Simple painting application
Create a simple drawing application from scratch.
There will be a few drawing tools required to be implemented (e.g. a rectangle tool and a freehand brush).

* Creating a GUI with PySide
* Creating classes with inheritance



# Software
Software will be available on the windows machines in M and E building.

* Python 3.4 (make sure to get 3.4!)
* PySide (Qt)

# About Python

 * Garbage collected (like Matlab, Java)
 * Dynamically typed (like Matlab, unlike Java)
 * Compiles to bytecode (like Java, Matlab in some cases)
 * Object Oriented programming (like Java, unlike Matlab)
 * Has concept of references (like Java, unlike Matlab)
 * Interactive interpreter (like Matlab, unlike Java)
 * Compact syntax (like Matlab, unlike Java)
 * Scripting support in many applications



# Why Python

  * Simple syntax
  * Easy to get started on all platforms
  * Similar concepts as other popular procedural languages (Java, C++, C#).
  * Common scripting language in applications, e.g.

    `[C library] <-> [Python wrapper] <-> [GUI code]`
    `[C++ program] <-> [Evaluate user scripts]`



# Python 3 vs Python 2

  * We'll be sticking to Python 3.4
  * A few incompatible syntax changes
  * A few noteable differences:
      - Printing: `print x`{.python} $\leadsto$ `print(x)`{.python}
      - Integer division `a / b` $\leadsto$ `a // b`
      - Proper unicode
      - Dictionaries: `x.has_key(y)`{.py} $\leadsto$ `y in x`{.python}
      - Renamed functions: `y.iteritems()`{.python} $\leadsto$ `y.items()`{.python}
  * Python 2.6-2.7 very much widespread, but Python 3.x is the future.


# Running Python code

  * Running a single program, once:
    `$ python myscript.py  inputarguments`
    where `inputarguments` are typically filenames or options used in command line interfaces.
    (on windows, this is what happens when you choose "open with" python.exe on a python script)
  * First time running a script will generate a `pyc` file. This is compiled bytecode that is cached (safe to remove).
  * Running only
    `$ python`
    starts an interactive interpreter.
  * More convenient to run scripts through an IDE when developing.



# Using an IDE (PyCharm)

  * An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a pimped up text editor that integrates the toolchain.
  * Running a script
      1. Create a small script `foobar.py`
      2. Run $\to$ Edit Configurations: Press + and select your script.
      3. Name the configuration and press OK.
      4. Run $\to$ Run 'Your script'

  * Python console at the bottom for convenience

  * PyCharm can read IPython notebooks (you need to start the notebook server on your computer)

  * Learn the [keyboard shortcuts](http://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/files/2010/07/PyCharm_Reference_Card.pdf)!

      * Ctrl + Mouse click for code navigation
      * Ctrl + Shift + arrow to move lines around
      * Many other useful things

  * You are free to use any IDE you want, but PyCharm is the best tool you will have access to during the exam.



# Short note on VCS

  * Version control systems (VCS) is a key component when developing and collaborating on larger projects
      * Subversion (a.k.a SVN) - Common centralized VCS
      * GIT - Distributed version control system. <www.github.com> is a popular hosting service.
      * Any decent IDE will integrate support for VCS. 
      * Dropbox is not a VCS.
  * Not really critical in this course
      * Your programs will mostly be short, and a learning experience
      * If you are interested, feel free to ask about it more during the computer session


# IPython

  * IPython has convenient macros outside the Python language
    * Similar to the Matlab console
    * Syntax highlighting warnings/errors (inside the console!)
      * Magic functions
```python
%timeit x = sqrt(37)
10000000 loops, best of 3: 52.4 ns per loop
```

  * IPython notebooks; "*The IPython Notebook is a web-based interactive computational environment where you can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a single document*"

    [SymPy](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/2.x/examples/Notebook/SymPy.ipynb)

    [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/3d-plots-tutorial/)



# IPython
  * Use as a calculator
      - Using previous outputs:

        ```python
In [1]: 2**3 + 75*2 - 45/4
Out[1]: 146.75
In [2]: 31536000 / Out[1]
Out[2]: 214896.0817717206
        ```

        Like `'ans'` in Matlab but better

  * Run a script similar to Matlab console
    
    ```python
In [1]: %run myscript.py
In [2]: whos
Variable   Type    Data/Info
----------------------------
x          int     3
    ```

  * Starting a notebook session

      * `$ ipython cmd notebook`
      * Windows: Run IPython 3.4 notebook from start menu
      * School windows: Copy the shortcut IPython 3.4 notebook from start menu to the desktop. Go to properties to change it to run from Z: instead of C:

    Use web browser or PyCharm to work with documents
