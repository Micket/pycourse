    "* You should not need to refer to the *view* to determine the state of the game. It should be isolated neatly in a separate *model* (e.g. the state of the game). I have seen people try to read the labels of a GUI widget to determine the state of the game. \n",
    "* The *model* should (probably) tell the *view* when something has changed (and nothing more).\n",
    "* Don't try to optimize to only do partial updates. Keep it simple and just tell all the views to update everything instead of trying to do partial updates. Computers are fast and probing the model for a few values is likely very fast compared to drawing the UI."
