[b]Pinnipeds[/b] (/ˈpɪnᵻˌpɛdz/), (from Latin pinna "fin" and pes, pedis "foot"[2]) commonly known as 
[b]seals[/b], are a widely distributed and diverse clade of carnivorous, [b]fin-footed[/b], [i]semiaquatic[/i] [b]marine mammals[/b].

They comprise the extant families [i]Odobenidae[/i] (whose only living member is the [i]walrus[/i]), 
Otariidae (the eared [b]seals[/b]: [b]sea lions[/b] and [b]fur seals[/b]), and [i]Phocidae[/i] (the earless seals, or true seals).
There are 33 extant species of pinnipeds, and more than 50 extinct species have been described from fossils.
While [b]seals[/b] were historically thought to have descended from two ancestral lines, molecular evidence supports them as a monophyletic lineage (descended from one ancestral line).
Pinnipeds belong to the order Carnivora and their closest living relatives are bears and [i]musteloids[/i] (weasels, raccoons, skunks and red pandas), [i]having diverged about[/i] [b]50 million years[/b] ago.
