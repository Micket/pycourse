After being born, [b]kittens[/b] are totally dependent on their [i]mother[/i] for survival and do not normally 
open their eyes until after seven to [b]ten[/b] days.

After about [b]two[/b] weeks, kittens quickly develop and begin to explore the world outside the nest. After a 
further three to four weeks, they begin to eat [b]solid food[/b] and grow adult teeth. Domestic [b]kittens[/b] are 
[i]highly social[/i] animals and enjoy human companionship.
