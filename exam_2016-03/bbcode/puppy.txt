A [b]puppy[/b] is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1–3 lb (0.45–1.36 kg), while larger ones can weigh up to 
15–23 lb (6.8–10.4 kg).
All healthy puppies grow quickly after birth. A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older, 
as is commonly seen in breeds such as the  [i]Yorkshire Terrier[/i]. In vernacular English, puppy refers 
specifically to dogs while pup may often be used for other mammals such as [b]seals[/b], [b]giraffes[/b], 
[b]guinea pigs[/b], or even [b]rats[/b].
